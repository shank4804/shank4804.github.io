      <description>I kept running into the same frustration: every LLM has blind spots. Ask GPT a question, you get GPT&amp;rsquo;s particular style and biases. Same with Claude, same with Gemini. The answers aren&amp;rsquo;t wrong, but they&amp;rsquo;re shaped by each model&amp;rsquo;s training, tendencies, and assumptions.
I wanted a tool where I could ask all three the same question simultaneously and watch them debate each other - like a group chat where AI models challenge each other&amp;rsquo;s reasoning.</description>

      <description>I am starting a series where I break down AI products to understand what they are building, why it matters, and whether the business makes sense. First up: Hebbia - The AI platform for finance.
The problem: An auditability crisis Here&amp;rsquo;s what makes Hebbia interesting. They are not solving a &amp;ldquo;search&amp;rdquo; problem. They are solving what I&amp;rsquo;d call an auditability crisis.
Private equity firms and law firms can&amp;rsquo;t just throw documents into ChatGPT and trust whatever comes out.</description>

      <description>My previous blog post was almost 2 years ago on my thoughts on why I am switching my career from engineering to product management.
Now, its been 2 years into the PM job while surviving layoffs in the tech industry (till now atleast).
Given that, I have some perspectives on this role (mostly at Microsoft) and what it could be going forward.
Product management experience so far Product management is very different across different companies.</description>

      <description>Since Jan 2022, I switched careers from being an SDE to PM. I wanted to share my thoughts here on &amp;ldquo;Why&amp;rdquo; did want to switch careers:
What do I want to do in my career? As of July 11th 2022, I would hit 6+ years in Software Engineering career. I would have learnt a lot in semiconductors (Intel), SaaS (Workday), ML platforms (AWS). I would be at a point in my career where I have been good at how to build a product.</description>

      <description>[Update as of April 2022] Shutdown the podcast because of following reasons:   Super tedious to edit / create videos + audio.
  Less viewership.
  Didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy doing it anymore because of 1 and 2 where the feedback loop to do it further was not there.
  Learnings from running the podcast and shutting it:   Creating media content which users want to listen / view is pretty hard.</description>

      <description>Amazing series of tweets on wealth generation by Naval Ravikant who is the founder of AngelList and an investor in a host of successful companies.
The podcast discussing these tweets:
And the link to the original thread of tweets:
Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.</description>

      <description>Helps do 3 things better for Software Engineers:
  Reduce time programming: Move from rule based program (logic) to writing programs where we feed it a data and we get results from it which are closer to the result.
  Customize products for specific users: Ex: Instead of writing two programs for English / French users, just write a general ML program and feed it English / French to generate language specific results.</description>

      <description>I was watching through Joma&amp;rsquo;s video on his YouTube channel about a guy named Cyrus Xi receiving amazing offers and I think his tips on preparing / learning in general are worth documenting. So, here it is.
Video link:   His reddit posts:  Pre-FB: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b3w1gg/2_year_update_my_journey_tips_29_gpa_at_a_small/ Currently after getting Uber, Snap etc.: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9i0pow/graduated_with_a_24_gpa_1_year_ago_after_studying/  His study guide: https://workflowy.com/s/study-guide/RD5kZ682pWX5oxiE
Along the read, I found this amazing article on Career Planning. Seems it was originally written by Marc Andreessen.</description>

      <description>I took this course as a part of Spring 2019 semester coursework at UC Berkeley extension.
I see soo many engineers jumping on the Product bandwagon. I signed up for this to get a sense of what the fuss is all about.
UC Berkeley extension is a program from UC Berkeley where individual courses from various departments can be taken as evening sessions in SF or Berkeley campus. Seems like it is targeted for folks looking to learn a new skill or for a career switch.</description>

      <description>I recently started writing some code in Go (or Golang?) there are lot of amazing things to explore. Its always exciting to learn a new language.
So far, I absolutely love Golang. If you are like me who likes C, Python and all this systems/low level OS stuff, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a feeling that Golang for systems will be similar to what JS is for the web. (+ve JS things :-) ).</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a world of microservices. With soo many companies containerizing their apps and scaling them using Kubernetes, it&amp;rsquo;s hard not to ignore.
To an idea of Kubernetes and to play around with it, I created this tutorial to install and deploy dockerized apps on a kubernetes cluster.
This tutorial has 3 parts:
  Dockerizing an API
  Deploying a Kubernetes cluster
  Deploying the Dockerized API on the cluster and exposing it.</description>

      <description>Ever since I wanted to contribute to an open-source project, I was told on online forums to contact the specific IRC channels to ask questions and start contributing. That&amp;rsquo;s fine. I&amp;rsquo;ll do that. But I never understood what was IRC.
So what&amp;rsquo;s IRC? Wikipedia quotes &amp;lsquo;Internet Relay Chat Protocol (IRCP) is an application layer protocol that facilitates communication in the form of text. The chat process works on a client/server networking model.</description>

      <description>Title: Beyond &amp;ldquo;Vibe Coding&amp;rdquo;: How I Built a Multi-LLM Debate Platform with Opus 4.5
I kept running into the same frustration: every LLM has blind spots. Ask GPT a question, you get GPT&amp;rsquo;s particular style and biases. Same with Claude, same with Gemini. I wanted a tool where I could ask all three the same question simultaneously and watch them debate each other—like a group chat where AI models challenge each other&amp;rsquo;s reasoning.</description>

      <description>Ever notice how asking ChatGPT vs Claude the same question gives you completely different answers? Not just in style, but in substance, assumptions, and blind spots.
That’s why I built AI Trio (https://ai-trio.cloud ): ask GPT-5, Gemini, and Claude the same question simultaneously and watch them respond and debate in a group chat format.
I built this over a few weekends using Claude Code + Opus 4.5, treating it as an experiment in the new AI-driven product development workflow to answer: “Could I really go from PRD to a working prototype with AI handling most of the implementation?</description>
