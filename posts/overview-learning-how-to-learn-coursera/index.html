<h1>Overview of Learning How to Learn Coursera course</h1>


<p>This is my notes on the overview of all the contents of course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">Learning How to Learn</a> from Coursera.</p>

<h2 id="week-1-focused-vs-diffused-thinking">Week 1: Focused vs Diffused thinking</h2>

<ol>
<li>In focused thinking the brain acts like a congested pin ball machine. So, if we know something before hand, the ball goes around and falls in that specific direction. But for unknown things, with focused thinking, we keep going in the same direction and we may not get to the solution. Why because the pins in the pin ball machine are congested.</li>
<li>However, in the Diffused thinking, the pins in the pin ball machine are very wide apart. So, if we do not know an answer for something, the pin ball has the chance to move around and make new connection and thus can develop new solutions.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, if you are getting stuck, take a step back. Relax your brain but still have the problem back in the mind so that the diffused thinking keeps working in the background. Then come back into focused thinking and see if you can find something new.</p>

<p>Basically, take a break. Fresh up. And look at the problem again.</p>

<h3 id="brain-synapse-growth">Brain synapse growth</h3>

<p>Apparently practicing the same thing again and again make the synapse in the brain neurons grow. So, praticing the same things again and make make the brain better in that particular task mainly cause of synapse connection growth.</p>

<h3 id="procrastination">Procrastination</h3>

<p>It happens cause you are making the brain something painful and it doesn&rsquo;t want to do it. Like leetcoding continuously.</p>

<p>So, it is ok to take some break and start again. But since some have bad procrastination habits, a technique to concentrate better is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Study in focused mode for 25 mins.</li>
<li>Then take a break.</li>
<li>Satisfy the brain by doing those things like browsing web, gaming etc to decompress but still have the old problem etc. in the back of the mind. Basically, make the brain enter diffused mode to digest those thing slowly. (Practice Makes Permanent)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="memory">Memory</h3>

<p>Two types of memory, Long term and Short term.</p>

<p>Short term memory:
Basically like computer RAM. Apparently the brain can hold only 4 chunks of data in short term memory. Its like a blurry black board. We have to keep repeating things (like phone number) so that it stays in short term memory until it is moved to long term memory.</p>

<p>Long term memory:
Its like the persistent disks in a computer. Stuff gets stored in the long term memory only for several spaced repeatitions. Like instead of leetcoding for one day and chilling, leetcode consistently and take one day break and go back and revisit. Doing this, takes all those into the long term memory and retriving them is also easier.</p>

<p>Going to brain synapse, it seems there is some recycle mechanism with clears them in short term memory. But to make it store in long term, repeated practise is needed and those synapse won&rsquo;t go away soo easily.</p>

<h3 id="sleep">Sleep</h3>

<p>Sleep is the thing which make it possible to move things from short term memory to long term. But to make that happen, first the brain should work in focused mode and thing slowly diffuse it during sleep where it solidifies all those learnt concepts. During sleep, those neutran synapse connections grow.</p>

<p>Basically sleep,</p>

<ul>
<li>allows the brain to wash away metabolic toxins.</li>
<li>allows your brain to strengthen important parts of memories even as it erases less important memories</li>
<li>allows your brain a chance to rehearse difficult material&ndash;going over and over the tougher aspects of what you are trying to learn</li>
<li>makes a remarkable difference in your ability to figure out difficult problems and to understand what you are trying to learn.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="week-2-chunking-essentials">Week 2: Chunking Essentials</h2>

<p>Chunks are like pieces of information which are bind together to make a bigger information. Like if you know simple binary search,that is a binary search chunk. Using that chunk, we can create new chunks like quick select where those two chunks are combined to get bigger chunk.</p>

<p>To do this, in a non-stressed way, the focused thinking need to bring out older chunks and use those to create new chunks. It seems chunks are created by series of neurons firing together.</p>

<h3 id="creating-chunks">Creating chunks</h3>

<ul>
<li>Focused attendion</li>
<li>Complete understanding</li>
<li>Repeated Practise</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="steps-to-form-chunks-with-leetcode-context">Steps to form chunks with leetcode context</h3>

<ul>
<li>Start the chunking process with an example problem (or best rated solution on leetcode). Use that problem to form a base chunk and develop on those chunks. So, if a new problem is faced, using the existing chunks helps. Understand the connections between the steps while problem solving.</li>
<li>Hard focus (focused mode) when trying to form new chunks. In leetcode, focus fully into understanding the solution for 25 mins so that you don&rsquo;t procrastinate.<br /></li>
<li>Just watching a guitar play / footballer kick / other&rsquo;s leetcode solution won&rsquo;t help create the chunks. You yourself should do it to create those chunks. The best way to form chunks in problem solving is to solve it yourself. Solving it yourself solidifies the solution to the problem. In leetcode, try to solve the problem yourself.</li>
<li>Get big picture of the material before diving in the details. Bottom up is chunking. Top down is context. In leetcode, parallely think on how this problem can be applied to other problem in top down fashion. Maybe the related problem tag will help to solidify this problem type.</li>
<li>All this along with more practice helps to solidify those neural patterns in the brain. Keep repeatin these to obtain mastery. (become leet God!)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="illusion-of-competence">Illusion of Competence</h4>

<p>If we just passive see a solution to a problem. Like say you just look at the leetcode solution, you are not creating those chunk connections in the brain. You feel like you know it but you don&rsquo;t.</p>

<h4 id="mini-testing">Mini-testing</h4>

<p>To check if you are not in the illusion of competence, you need to do mini-tests on your knowledge or problem. The best way to do this is by Recall. Applying this to leetcode, after you think you have understood the solution to the problem, try to imagine and recall the solution without seeing. If you think you know the algorithm, code it up in OJ.</p>

<h4 id="recall">Recall</h4>

<p>The best way to mini-test is the Recall. Recalling acts like an LRU cache for the neural connections in the brain. Each recall makes those concepts solid and helps to void the Illusion of Competence.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also helpful to recall when doing other things like showering, walking. That way, brain is given training to think outside of the study room and hence helps during test time or whiteboarding.</p>

<h4 id="making-mistakes">Making mistakes</h4>

<p>Making mistakes helps to correct thinking flaws / Illusion of Competence and make them better bit by bit. Better to make mistakes now than during test time.</p>

<h3 id="brain-chemicals">Brain chemicals</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Acetycholine: Focused mode. Also helps in long term memory.</p></li>

<li><p>Dopamine: Motivation. Released when we get a reward. Predicts future rewards. Drugs artifically increase this and hence hijack. Lack of this, makes you lose interest. The 25 mins rewards helps release this.</p></li>

<li><p>Serotonin: Social life. Anti-depressant increase serotonin. Lower serotonin = higher risk takers.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Emotions are inter twined with logic / mental stuff. So, both are necessary for learning.</p>

<h3 id="chunk-transfer">Chunk Transfer</h3>

<p>Collection of chunks when they are very well ingrained, can be used to form other chuncks. This is called <code>transfer</code> of chunks. This happens when the first chuncks are rock solid in the long term memory.</p>

<p>This is possible by connecting the chunks in diffused mode and later finding an answer to the problem in the focused mode.</p>

<h3 id="problem-solving-types">Problem solving types</h3>

<ol>
<li>Sequential = focused mode. (just follow steps one after another).</li>
<li>Holisting = global (get a global view of the problem)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="law-of-serendipity">Law of Serendipity</h3>

<p><code>Lady luck favors the one who tries</code></p>

<p>Start by solving. It is hard initially. But as you chew through it, it becomes easier.</p>

<h3 id="overlearning">Overlearning</h3>

<p>Repeatedly re-reading the mastered topic is overlearning. Overlearnining helps in tests / public speaking. This way overlearning become autonomous to avoid nervousness.</p>

<p>But overlearning gives the illusion of competence for all the contents of the material. But in reality, only the overlearned portion will be studied well.</p>

<h3 id="deliberate-practise">Deliberate practise</h3>

<p>Deliberately focusing on difficult part of the subject is deliberate practise. It&rsquo;s to void overlearning. This makes the difference between a good student (overlearning) vs great student (learning + deliberate practise).</p>

<h3 id="einstellung-bias">Einstellung (bias)</h3>

<p>Phenomenon where you always think in terms of the same thing. Instead of finding new ways of doing things, you always do the same thing so that new innovative think is hindered. Like in focused mode where the thought always went to initial thought.</p>

<p>It means mindset in German. It means installing a roadblock.</p>

<h3 id="interleaving">Interleaving</h3>

<p>Practising to jump around techniques. Start from problem solving one technique, master it and suddently go back and look at other mastered techniques. This helps to link those chunks in the brain and try to make a conneciton. Mix up and match.</p>

<p>This make the brain to learn how to use a technique in which situation. Skipping around problem while tests will help to learn more deeply.</p>

<p>Solid learning = same concept improved by practise and repeatition. Interleaving = creativity to solve new problems by connecting two or more chunks / techniques.</p>

<p>Deeper = Solid knowledge on one concept. But entrenched. Hard to find innovative ideas.
Broader = Super innovating cause can connect fields. But not to great in any concept.</p>

<p><code>Most innovation in science happens by young people or by folks from other fields. This is because they are not blocked by Einstellung from old training.</code></p>
