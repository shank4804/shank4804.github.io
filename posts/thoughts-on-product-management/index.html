<h1>Thoughts on Product Management</h1>
<p>My previous <a href="https://shashankkumar.me/posts/switching-to-product-management/" target="_blank">blog post </a>was almost 2 years ago on my thoughts on why I am switching my career from engineering to product management.</p>
<p>Now, its been 2 years into the PM job while surviving layoffs in the tech industry (till now atleast).</p>
<p>Given that, I have some perspectives on this role (mostly at Microsoft) and what it could be going forward.</p>
<h2 id="product-management-experience-so-far">Product management experience so far</h2>
<p>Product management is very different across different companies. The common definition which most agree on are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Understanding customer&rsquo;s said needs and unarticulated needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating products that actually satisfy the needs and can be a sustainable business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding the market through various lenses (Porter&rsquo;s Five Forces as an example) to see where it is going while being aware of any competition and new innovations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working with various stakeholders internally and externally to drive impact in 2.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>My experience so far has been farely good in all of these. I learnt a lot on working with stakeholders to drive impact towards building and shipping customer asked product features by doing activities such as writing product spec docs, building UXs with design, working with engineering on building cloud scale products, executing on various Go-To-Market efforts and learning on what it takes to price a product financially to sustain it as a business.</p>
<h2 id="pming-at-microsoft">PMing at Microsoft</h2>
<p>As said before, each company does product management differently and Microsoft only recently in 2023 officially split the previous generic &ldquo;program manager&rdquo; title and job duties into product management and technical program management. Because of the somewhat recent change, there is hangover in the old ways and product management here is slightly different in the way other &ldquo;cooler&rdquo; companies in the silicon valley define it. It still has lingering aspects of program management where working with the nitty-gritty details with engineering looks to be the norm.</p>
<p>As a stark contrast from my previous experience working as an software development engineer in AWS and elsewhere, my interaction with my team&rsquo;s product manager was minimal and mostly around sharing and describing customer issues / feedback which was shared to us. PMs elsewhere were generally more externally facing, focusing more on the customer, discovering their unsaid needs, and building strategy for the long term. They never had to sit down with us in engineering to define what APIs, CLI / SDKs, address scale challenges etc. I am still not sure if it is because AWS engineering is expected to have a strong sense of ownership and bias for action where they should figure out everything themselves on what it takes in building a product without much help.</p>
<h2 id="missing-out-in-the-overall-product-experience">Missing out in the overall product experience</h2>
<p>My experience till now has had less focus on thinking about the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; and the &ldquo;What&rdquo; and a lot more focus on the &ldquo;how&rdquo;. Meaning, a lot of work so far tends to be on the day to day execution of building the software product and less time thinking on the big picture. As an engineer who still codes for fun on the side, I am fine with it. But as a career in product management, I am wary that the skills needed in thinking the big picture strategy, discovering customer&rsquo;s unarticulated problems seems to be missing in the overall &ldquo;deal&rdquo; and sometimes feels like I am mindlessly executing on someone else&rsquo;s vision without much say.</p>
<p>I wonder if this is because I am underleveled. Maybe my switch from engineering to product set me back by years. My knowledge about the cloud domain from an engineering perspective might be of a higher seniority there but the official product management experience is lesser.</p>
<p>I am still hopeful to learn the gaps ASAP and grow in the product track with a growth mindset. :)</p>
<h2 id="future-of-product-management">Future of product management</h2>
<p>Due to the higher interest rates in the macro economy, companies across the board are now generally reluctant to hire personnel in any job function be in engineering or product. Startup founders now tend to be the product managers themselves and are worried to give away the product decision making to others. The AI trend with LLMs seems unstoppable with each day, out innovating the day before.</p>
<p>In general, product management seems to be not much of a sought-after career path. The number of product managers needed in this economy is a lot less. With AI in the mix, the demand for PMs could remain flat for a while with existing PMs being more empowered to do more with less.</p>
<h2 id="any-regrets-in-switching-to-product">Any regrets in switching to product?</h2>
<p>Despite calling out on what is missing in my product experience, <strong>I heartfully thank Microsoft and my current management leadership in giving me this opportunity to practise product management</strong>. I still see my product experience being super valuable. I have one less regret in life. I am doing something beyond the software engineering which I did in my previous life.</p>
<p>I now get to have a strong say in product features, how they get to look and feel, guide and unblock fellow colleagues and working with different stakeholders balancing each&rsquo;s motivation.</p>
<p>I still think these will help me someday when I want to have a business of my own or when AGI becomes very good at completing tasks and the world would need more of &ldquo;idea people&rdquo; since the doing would be offloaded to an AI.</p>
